# Personal-Portfolio

## Local development

To run the portfolio locally (static server):

- Ensure Node.js is installed (LTS recommended). You can install via winget or from https://nodejs.org/.
- Start the tiny provided server (from project root):

```bash
node static-server.js
```

This serves the site on http://127.0.0.1:5500/.

(Alternatively you can use the Live Server VS Code extension or `npx live-server`.)
